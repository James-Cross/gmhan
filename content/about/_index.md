    ## What is the GMHAN?


    The Greater Manchester Homelessness Action Network (GMHAN) is a network for
    everyone working to end homelessness in Greater Manchester. The Network
    brings together all the different sectors and specialisms involved in this
    ambition, so we can work together towards a common cause. 


    We does this through large scale quarterly events aimed at co-designing
    Greater Manchester's homelessness policy and showcasing best practice. We
    also have an Advisory Board to work on topics raised in between events and
    promote the Network's voice on the GM Homelessness Programme Board (which is
    where decisions are made). 


    The Network is cross sector, including representatives from all ten Greater
    Manchester boroughs. Most importantly, it operated on the basis of
    'community development' and co-production*, bringing people together to work
    side by side rather than alone or in hierarchies.


    ![Information flows from the Network events through the Advisory Board to
    the Programme Board and operational teams delivering services or
    interventions. It also comes back the other way in a continual feedback
    loop.]( "GMHAN Structure")

    ## How the Advisory Board works


    The GMHAN Advisory Board is a core group of people who have experience
    across homelessness and interconnected issues within Greater Manchester.


    Members are anyone interested in taking a more active role in the
    organisation of the GMHAN and in strengthening a community development
    approach to ending homelessness.


    Members are 'brokers' in their areas of work, acting as bridges into their
    sector to ensure there is an exchange of information and knowledge from the
    ground up and vice versa. They currently include voluntary sector
    partnership managers, Combined Authority officers, faith leaders, university
    researchers, co-production experts and housing provider representatives. The
    ambition is for this membership to expand to fill gaps in all specialisms
    and geographical areas.


    The Terms of Reference for the Board are available **[here](<link resources
    page Terms of Reference doc>):**


    The Advisory Board has two components which reflect its dual functions of
    action:


    ![The Advisory Board has fortnightly 'Action Sessions' alongside more formal
    'Accountability Meetings' for making decisions]( "Advisory Board
    components")




    ## What have we achieved so far?


    The HAN has been established to achieve long-term systems change so that no
    one need become homeless in Greater Manchester. We're not looking for quick
    fixes. Examples of what the HAN has been involved in since starting in 2017
    include:


    * Taking the decision to deliver the Bed Every Night emergency shelter
    scheme, which has halved rough sleeping in Greater Manchester.

    * Raising the question of family homelessness to the Programme Board Chaired
    by the Mayor Andy Burnham to change the approach to how families are
    supported in temporary accomodation

    * Shining the spotlight on youth homelessness, resulting in the development
    of a second Social Impact Bond programme focused on this issue

    * Supporting the evolution of a community night shelter in a local borough
    into a formal commissioned partner of the Bed Every Night programme
