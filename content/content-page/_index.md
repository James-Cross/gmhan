    Giving money is one of the simplest and most effective ways you can make a
    difference to homelessness in Greater Manchester. The Homeless Action
    Network itself has no costs, so weâ€™d encourage people to give to other
    causes within Greater Manchester.

    Support people directly through local 'personalised grant' schemes. These
    initiatives cover the cost of essential items which help people get away
    from the streets or avoid ending up there in the first place.

    Local community and charitable organisations are the frontline of our
    response to homelessness. Their staff and volunteers work tirelessly, and a
    donation to them can make a huge difference to what they are able to
    achieve.




    To see what organisations are active in your area, go to the [Street Support
    website](https://streetsupport.net).

    Get behind a city-wide campaign which is honing in on a specific homeless
    challenge in our city.




    Right now, the big effort GM partners are putting in is the provision of
    emergency night shelters as a first step off the streets (and so no one
    sleeps out in the cold).
