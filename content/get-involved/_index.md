    If you have lived experience of homelessness, or are involved with a project
    working to end homelessness in Greater Manchester, then we want you to be a
    part of the Network. There are multiple ways to be involved:


    * Sign up to the [Mailing
    List](https://streetsupport.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=da9a1d4bb2b1a69a981456972&id=3c6ae13085)
    to hear about new events and activities

    * Attend the wider network events every three months. These usually take
    place at Salford University and will be advertised through the mailing list
    and on the [News And Events](/news-and-events) page.

    * Let us know about good practice in ending homelessness that you are
    involved in, or a problem you've spotted that you don't think is being
    addressed by contacting email@gmhan.net 

    * Volunteer to be part of the Advisory Board 'Action Meetings' focused on
    delivering this year's key priorities (see [here](<link to About section on
    vision>))

    * Volunteer to be the link person for your borough or field of work. To see
    which areas we're looking for representatives from, follow [this link](<link
    to About members bit>)




    ## Other ways to get involved


    Not everyone can get involved in everything, and that's fine. If you are a
    member of the public, you may find it easier to:


    1. Give money: find out more about the best ways you can donate to ending
    homelessness on our [Giving page](/give)

    2. Give time or items: go to our partner website at [Street
    Support](streetsupport.net) to see what volunteering opportunities or need
    for items there are in your area
