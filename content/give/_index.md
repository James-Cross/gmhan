    [**DONATE**](https://www.justgiving.com/campaign/No-Child-Should-Go-Hungry-Fund)
    to support the fight to end holiday hunger in Greater Manchester Greater
    Manchester is stepping up support for children and young people who need
    access to good quality food during the school holiday periods. Despite an
    extension to the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) Covid Local Support
    Grant until 30 September 2021 and the provision of Holiday Activities and
    Food Programme Funding, information received from the 10 Greater Manchester
    local authorities has identified a Â£5 million funding gap in food provision
    for children and young people.


    In Greater Manchester there has been a rise in the number of children and young people who are eligible for free school meals. Data from the January 2021 school census indicates that over 120,000 school pupils across Greater Manchester schools were eligible for free school meals. This is approximately 26% of all pupils.


    There are also a significant number of children and families who are not entitled to free school meals but are suffering from financial hardship. The COVID-19 pandemic has created a series of contributing factors where people are in a more vulnerable position but may not be eligible for additional support. This includes increased unemployment and deprivation and the insecurity that the end of furlough of the lifting of the eviction ban brings.


    Greater Manchester Combined Authority has set up a funding platform in collaboration with Forever Manchester to support the No Child Should Go Hungry initiative to alleviate holiday hunger. This will allow the residents of Greater Manchester to donate to help people who may be in a vulnerable position.


    To cover the cost of administration and support their work in local communities across Greater Manchester, Forever Manchester will receive 8% of all donations received.
