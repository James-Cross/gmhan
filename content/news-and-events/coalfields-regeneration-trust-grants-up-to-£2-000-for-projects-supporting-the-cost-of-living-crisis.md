    **Grants up to £2,000 for projects supporting the cost of living crisis**


    Following the impact of the pandemic on the income and employment and the increase in cost of living, people are finding it harder to make ends meet and low income households are having to choose between food and fuel.


    These small grants are available to help organisations provide the much needed support with food and fuel, we appreciate that there has also been an impact on mental health as a result of the pandemic and more people are isolated.


    The types of projects we hope to fund are:


    * Food Poverty Projects

    * Information, Advice & Guidance projects

    * Social groups

    * Projects supporting homelessness

    * Or any other project that would benefit those in crisis


    Decisions will be made regularly as applications are received and until this year's allocation of funding has been committed.
