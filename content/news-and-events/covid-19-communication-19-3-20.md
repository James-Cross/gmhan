    *The below information is to support local responses across Greater
    Manchester. Please refer to your Local Authority first and foremost for the
    latest guidance and advice, or sign up to the GMHAN mailing list for regular
    updates.*


    It is vitally important that we all follow public health advice fully –
    taking collective responsibility to ensure we reduce harm wherever possible.


    In addition to local authority responses, there is co-ordination at a city
    region level


    * *A GM forum has been set up to provide co-ordination and
    visibility,identify and respond to local challenges, and to escalate
    regional challenges to national level.*

    * *Key issues being considered include NRPF*, self isolation accommodation,
    drug dependency support, transport, criminal exploitation, support for
    people at risk of losing their housing or jobs, and more.*

    * *There will also be a GM ‘Mutual Aid’ response to coordinate volunteering
    for the crisis, , and there will be a section specific for homelessness.
    Again details are being worked out, more info to follow.*




    **For general advice around COVID-19 and homelessness, please see
