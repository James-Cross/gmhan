    T﻿he Food Foundation has released [interesting data
    ](https://foodfoundation.org.uk/publication/child-food-insecurity-doubles-fueling-calls-urgent-expansion-free-school-meals)around
    public support for the expansion of Free School Meals, including new data on
    child food insecurity and constituency level FSM support.


    The key headlines are:


    *  the number of households where children are not getting enough nutritious food has nearly doubled in the past year. In January 2023, 21.6% of households with children reported that their children had directly experienced food insecurity in the past month, affecting an estimated 3.7 million children. This is compared with 11.6% in January 2022. More detail on our food insecurity tracker [here](https://www.foodfoundation.org.uk/initiatives/food-insecurity-tracking).

    *  The first national modelling of support for Free School Meals expansion across England’s parliamentary constituencies, which shows overwhelming support for Government action. The data from a national sample of 8,000 respondents, show eight out of ten people in England (80%) now support the Government providing Free School Meals for children in households receiving Universal Credit.
