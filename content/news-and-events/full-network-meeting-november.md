    We hope you can join others involved in tackling homelessness for the next
    full, online, quarterly Homelessness Action Network event.


    We are dedicating this session to **GM Homelessness Prevention Strategy (GMHPS)** which seeks to build a coherent system that embed additional policy changes to reflect that. The GMHPS seeks to broaden the scope of homelessness prevention activity and drive the implementation of the Greater Manchester Model for Public Service Reform to change how we go about preventing homelessness.


    We will hear from **Mayor Andy Burnham** and colleagues at the GM Combined Authority to speak about their firm strategic commitment to prevention and early intervention to address homelessness.


    As GMHAN network we developed to provide a space for independent and cross-sector collaboration, innovation, and scrutiny.


    We thank everyone who helped shape the strategy including all our colleagues from the Greater Manchester Homelessness Programme Board, housing practice, and policy, as well as people who have been through the homelessness system, all the policy proposals drawn from the legislative theatre events, and those who have the knowledge and experience of what was needed to do to prevent and reduce homelessness in all its forms. 


    To reserve your place, [please register here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/gmhan-full-network-event-tickets-141953018299) and the joining information, as well as a copy of the GMHPS draft, will follow before the event.


    Please share with commissioners, partners, frontline staff, and especially people with lived experience of homelessness or currently accessing services for a wider representation of voices.
