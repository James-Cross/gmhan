    The Asda Foundation supports small, grass roots organisations in several ways throughout the year. Working with Asda’s Community Champions in store, they are able to work with a range of organisations and groups on a variety of local community projects. Below are the different ways they support communities.


    * **Cost of Living** is an Asda Foundation grant for local groups aimed at supporting increasing running costs groups will face between September 2022 and February 2023. 


    This grant is open to groups helping to address this issue. The application window is 19th September – February and will close as soon as the budget cap is reached. Read the guidance [here](https://www.asdafoundation.org/how-to-apply) and if your group and project meet the criteria, talk to your local Asda Community Champion about applying.
