    * **Everyone is able to sustain a home that is safe, decent, and affordable**

    * **Everyone leaves our places of care (care, health facility, prison, asylum) with a safe**

    * **place to go**

    * **Where people are at imminent risk of homelessness they are able to access quality**

    * **advice, advocacy, and support**

    * **No one is forced to sleep rough and temporary accommodation supports respite,**

    * **recovery and re-connection**

    * **Homelessness is not an entrenched or repeat the experience**


    **The aim is to embed prevention as a systematic approach through all Greater Manchester services with a specific focus on the stages at which people may be at risk of homelessness or repeat homelessness.**


    **The Homelessness Prevention Strategy sets out the steps Greater Manchester needs to take over the next five years to help tackle homelessness and rough sleeping in Greater Manchester.**
