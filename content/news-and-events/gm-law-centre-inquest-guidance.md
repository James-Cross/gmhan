  body: >-
    There has been a steep rise in the number of homeless deaths during the
    COVID-19 pandemic, and only a small portion seem to be due to the virus
    itself. It is especially worrying that the numbers have risen at a time when
    the ‘Everyone In’ policy was in place to house rough sleepers


    National partners including Shelter, the GM Law Centre and Museum of Homelessness have come together to produce a a short guide to the inquest process for bereaved families whose loved ones have died in emergency or hostel accommodation during the COVID-19 pandemic.


    You can download the Guide describing the inquest process by following [this link](https://www.gmhan.net/assets/uploads/inquests-a-short-guide-for-bereaved-families-final-2-.pdf).
