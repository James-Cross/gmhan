  heading: New funding round for GM frontline organisations
  body: >-
    Launching today, the 3rd June, Greater Manchester Mayor’s Charity is making
    an open call for applications for the fourth phase of the Emergency Response
    Funding. The primary aim of this fund is to support frontline organisations
    to begin to transition from a state of emergency response, adapting now to
    “living with Covid” and beginning the process of “building back better”.


    \

    **Who can apply?**


    This is a fund solely targeted at charities or not for profit organisations working either to reduce/end homelessness and/or supporting people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. You must be based in Greater Manchester and have been an active part of the emergency response to Covid19.\

    \

    You can apply in partnership with another organisation to make effective use of the funding. If this is the case, you need to nominate a Lead Applicant; and they will be the primary contact for GMMC in terms of the application process. They should complete this application form on behalf of your partnership.


    **What is the funding for?**


    GMMC recognise that many organisations have gone through rapid changes in the way they deliver services and how they have supported people over the last few months. Proposed projects should be based on how your organisation has responded so far, the changing needs of people experiencing homelessness in Greater Manchester, and how you plan as an organisation to adapt in response to this going forwards. They are looking specifically for schemes or projects that provide innovative solutions to gaps in provision within the sector at this challenging transitional time.


    \

    Nb. If you’re not sure what the next phase of this crisis really means for your organisation yet then please don’t worry – there will be other funding opportunities from GMMC in the future. This fund is intended for those organisations who have a clear sense of what they need to do next based on identified gaps and the shifts in provision made during the emergency response.


    \

    **What costs can you apply for?**


    Applications are for projects up to a maximum of £50,000 maximum. You can apply for both project costs and/or salaries. Projects can run for either one or two years. Please include a proportion of core costs to your bid to make the project realistic and manageable. Please note that we can only accept ONE application per organisation - so you cannot apply as both an individual and part of a partnership bid. We intend to fund up to a maximum of five projects.


    \

    **How to apply**


    The deadline for applications is 12 noon on 17th June 2020.

    GMMC appreciates that this is an incredibly busy time. They are aiming to work quickly and get decisions out to applicants by 28th June\
