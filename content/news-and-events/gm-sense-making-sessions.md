    So much is changing, the future is unclear, many plans are on hold, peopleâ€™s
    experiences differ wildly, and it is not easy to see the way ahead. To move
    forward and find ways that work for all we need opportunities to be with
    each other in and through all the uncertainty, and the space to consider
    deeply.


    We are inviting people from across GM networks to join us in doing this.


    We are taking a journey into deeper awareness, through creative sense making- including moments of stillness, being with all the unknown and vulnerability that brings.


    Through a series of facilitated structured and less-structured online sessions we will go through a collective sense making process - welcoming what is happening and what is emerging for us around how may we all thrive in increased insecurity.


    If this sounds like something for you please let us know here: [Signup form](https://forms.gle/1peiGYY7D2um5P2T8)


    Once you have registered your interest we will be in touch with further details.
