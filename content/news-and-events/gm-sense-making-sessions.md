    In this moment of uncertainty and transition, we are offering a series of
    sessions for people from across the GM Homelessness Action Network and other
    GM networks to come together to reflect on what is happening and emerging.


    Through a series of facilitated structured and less-structured online sessions we will take a journey into deeper awareness, through creative sense making, moments of stillness, sharing and deep listening. We will try out some different processes - welcoming what is happening and what is emerging for us, exploring being with the unknown and the vulnerability that brings.


    There is an initial space for anyone interested to find out more and for us to start to co-create this together on Friday 29/5 2-3.30pm, and then fortnightly sessions to be planned in through June to July/August.


    If this sounds like something for you might be interested in, or you are curious to try something new or know more, please [let us know here](https://forms.gle/1peiGYY7D2um5P2T8), or email [viv@streetsupport.net](<mailto: viv@streetsupport.net>).


    All welcome.  Please spread the word!
