    In this moment of uncertainty and transition, we are offering a series of
    sessions for people from across the GM Homelessness Action Network and other
    GM networks to come together to reflect on what is happening and emerging.


    We will be taking a journey into deeper awareness, through creative sense making- including moments of stillness, sharing what we see, and how it is to be with all the unknown and vulnerability that brings.


    Through a series of facilitated structured and less-structured online sessions we will go through a collective sense making process - welcoming what is happening and what is emerging for us around how may we all thrive in increased insecurity.


    If this sounds like something for you might be interested in, or are curious to know more, please let us know here: [Signup form](https://forms.gle/1peiGYY7D2um5P2T8)


    We will be in touch with further details.
