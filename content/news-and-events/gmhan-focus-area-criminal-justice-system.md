  body: >-
    T﻿he GMHAN brings people together across Greater Manchester to work towards
    a shared goal of tackling homelessness. This is a big and complex challenge,
    so our work is broken down into different 'sprints', which will explore one
    topic at a time across all the task groups and within our network events. As
    a network we will come together on these topics to push forward this work
    for a quarter, before moving on to the next network focus.


    W﻿e know that the criminal justice system can often be directly linked to homelessness, creating further barriers to accessing housing or support. There has been a lot of progress to tackle these barriers across Greater Manchester, so we want to highlight this good work while also identifying areas for further change.


    I﻿f you want to get involved in this work and help us change the system then get in touch info@GMHAN.net.
