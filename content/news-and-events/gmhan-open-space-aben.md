    A Bed Every Night is moving into its fourth phase. With every iteration, we
    aim to build on the previous service and improve the offer for individuals
    who are sleeping rough or at imminent risk of rough sleeping in Greater
    Manchester.


    The need to provide Covid-19 safe accommodation has meant a big change this year. ABEN 3 has seen an increase in the number of self-contained bed spaces allowing individuals to stay during the day without a need to re-register each night. There was also an enhanced focus on health and wellbeing services.


    Nevertheless, there remains challenges and the average length of stay in ABEN is increasing. The development focus for ABEN 4 is:


    * Maintaining current capacity

    * Exploring sustainability with Housing Benefit claims

    * Understanding what can be done differently for individuals who are multiply excluded (including duty discharged or individuals who return to ABEN)

    * Understanding the service for individuals who are new to homelessness


    We would like to explore and hear your feedback on


    * What is working well across GM?

    * What is not working well across GM

    * Suggested improvements for key cohortsÂ
