content:
  heading: What the Network feels needs to happen to end homelessness not rebuild
    a broken sytem
  body: >-
    Over the last month, the GMHANâ€™s members including people with lived
    experience of homelessness, frontline workers, researchers and decision
    makers have been inputting into what they feel needs to happen to end
    homelessness after COVID. 


    It covers what needs to happen short, medium and long term, including national policy asks and actions at Local and Combined Authority levels. We are now asking everyone with a stake in making this happen to raise and discuss in your own fields and forums or share on your own platforms. Our next full Network event is taking place on [September 9th](https://www.gmhan.net/news-and-events/full-network-meeting-september/) where we will be reviewing progress and would warmly welcome your input into the review we conduct then.
