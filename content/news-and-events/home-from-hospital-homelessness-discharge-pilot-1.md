    E﻿arlier this year we hosted an ‘Open Space’ with 10GM to to explore
    hospital discharge in Greater Manchester and bring together ideas to make
    use of a pot of funding aimed at improving outcome for people facing
    homelessness at the point of hospital discharge. From this we proposed a
    project which would pilot new interventions to improve hospital discharge
    experience through a link worker role. We are excited to announce that this
    project will be delivered by [Petrus Community](https://www.petrus.org.uk/),
    with additional match funding from the [Greater Manchester Mayors
    Charity](https://gmmayorscharity.org.uk/)


    The project will see a specialist Link Worker placed across Birch Hill Hospital and Rochdale Infirmary, who will strengthen partnerships within the primary care network and provide crucial support people at risk of homelessness. The Link Worker will act as a navigator to ensure safe hospital discharges and appropriate referrals to support networks.


    Petrus will utilize and embed their current community offer, including access to primary care via the [Homeless Alliance Response Team](https://www.rochdalehealthalliance.co.uk/hart), and access to health and wellbeing initiatives, as well as their menu of socially prescribed activity across various sites, in collaboration with NHS England and GM Integrated Care.


    T﻿hanks to everyone who was involved in this work!
