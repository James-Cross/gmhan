    The £2 million Homelessness Winter Transformation Fund is provided by the
    Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) and will award
    grants of between £10,000 and £100,000. It will be distributed by Homeless
    Link in partnership with Housing Justice, offering much needed support to
    the sector at a time when many services are at risk due to the ongoing
    impact of the pandemic.


    The Fund aims to ensure that faith and community groups who provide winter accommodation can this year provide single room COVID-19 secure accommodation, and will also support services that prevent rough sleeping and work with people sleeping rough in innovative ways. These will build on proven approaches such as hosting, shared houses, support working and accessing the private rented sector.


    The funding cannot be used to support traditional, dormitory-style night shelter provision and will seek to produce a legacy for the future of winter homelessness support.
