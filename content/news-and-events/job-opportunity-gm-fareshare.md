    This is an exciting opportunity to join the FareShare Greater Manchester team, supporting our vital work reducing food poverty and food waste in the GM region.


    It’s a busy and varied role which primarily focuses on account management, building and maintaining strong relationships with our Community Food Members (CFMs). The successful candidate will liaise with the FareShare GM Operations on account fulfilment, will coordinate monthly invoicing, will visit our charity customers, and will analyse data for the management team and external stakeholders.


    You’ll have excellent relationship management and communication skills (both verbal and written); proven customer service experience and strong numeracy skills are also essential.  You’ll be calm, organised and highly proficient in all administrative duties, and happy to pitch in and help wherever help is needed. FareShare supplies a wide and diverse variety of frontline charities and schools so you’ll need to be customer focused, and able to build the trust and engagement of a variety of community groups.


    We aim to encourage a culture where people can be themselves and be valued for their strengths, and wish to attract and employ the best people from the widest pool, reflecting the diverse range of people we support. Training will be provided.


    The **closing date** for completed applications is **noon on Monday 28th March 2022**. Interviews are expected to take place in mid-April 2022.
