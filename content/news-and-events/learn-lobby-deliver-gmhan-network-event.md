    Join the Greater Manchester Homelessness Action Network task groups on
    Wednesday 5th July to Learn, Lobby & Deliver! Over the past year since the
    task groups were established they have been working together to deepen
    partnership working across the city, improve standards of homelessness
    response & prevention, and improve the quality and transparency of
    information available.


    Join them to find out more about what they have been working on and help to push past the challenges they are facing and develop an action plan to support their work.


    T﻿his is also a great opportunity to find out more about what it means to be part of a task group and sign up to work with one of the groups in the future. The groups are open to everyone and we work to make sure they are accessible for all!
