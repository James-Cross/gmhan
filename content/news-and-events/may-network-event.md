    the pandemic
  body: >-
    We are very pleased to be getting back together in person for the first time
    in over two years. We've managed to get a lot done in two years of working
    online, including supporting the successful implementation of the 'Everyone
    In' emergency accommodation, how we could Build Back Better as a City Region
    and the first Homelessness Prevention Strategy & Action Plan for Greater
    Manchester. However, we're really glad to be able to meet physically and
    hope you can attend to join others in Greater Manchester working to end
    homelessness.


    **Details for the Event are:**


    Monday 23rd May, 10am-1pm\

    Methodist Central Hall\

    Oldham Street\

    We will be joined as usual by **Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham**, with opportunity to put questions to him about your ideas and concerns. The rest of the session will include:


    * Showcases of some of the fantastic work happening across GM

    * A focus on the Prevention Strategy and Action Plan,

    * How you can get more involved with the HAN's activities within our refreshed set up (more [here](https://www.gmhan.net/assets/uploads/gmhan-governance-structure-and-co-ordination-group-terms-of-reference-march-2022.pdf))

    * Networking time to reconnect with each other and find out what people are doing to end homelessness


    *People with lived experience of homelessness, frontline workers, commissioners and decision makers are all equally welcome at the HAN, so **please share** with colleagues, volunteers, contacts and people accessing services if you think they would like to come along.*
