    With the Strategy for Greater Manchester published and Action Plan being rolled out across the city, Local Homelessness Partnership will be an even more important part of ending and preventing homelessness in each of our local areas. With many of the ideas coming from local groups, Partnerships will also be vital in translating the recommendations from the Strategy into local action.


    In this session, we’ll be looking at best practice around creating and sustaining local homelessness partnerships. We’ll hear about how partnerships in Bury and Manchester have approached it, and have time for you to consider what matters for your partnership or forum in the place where you live or work.
