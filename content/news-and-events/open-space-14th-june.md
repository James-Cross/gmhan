    Lex and Robbie from the GMHAN Co-ordination Group are hosting this Open Space to review the notes which came out of that session and put a bit more flesh on the bones for anyone who wants to go a bit deeper.


    It's also a chance [if you are interested in being part of a 'Task Group'](https://www.gmhan.net/news-and-events/task-group-eoi/) to ask questions about what is involved. All welcome for as long or as short as you are able to join.
