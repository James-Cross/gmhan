  body: The Greater Manchester Food Security Action Network met for the third time
    on the 21st March 2022 since its inception in October 2021. This meeting was
    special however as it was our first meeting in person. The session was
    hosted at the Methodist Central Hall by our network Chair, Reverend Ian
    Rutherford and we had around 60 of our network members attend. The morning
    included updates from our three taskforce groups on their work to date and
    action plans moving forward, updates from our GMCA colleagues on the
    National picture and where we fit into it and also some inspiring stories
    from Rose and Karen at Sawn and Sam at the Message Trust. Alongside updates
    and contributions from our speakers we were able to break out into our three
    taskforce groups to discuss how we can all further the actions of the groups
    and how we can better work together. We were also lucky enough to have food
    cooked by our members Cracking Good Food which we all enjoyed together at
    the end of the session. To see what was discussed in the session you can
