  heading: Invitation to tender for Rough Sleeper Accommodation Programme Phase 2
  body: >-
    The Rough Sleeper Accommodation Programme (RSAP) was introduced in 2020 by
    the Government to support 6000 rough sleepers into long term accommodation.
    The programme provided capital funding to deliver additional move-on
    properties for individuals who experienced rough sleeping and revenue to
    provide support to the move-on properties. 


    This contract is to deliver the support element to the properties acquired by the GMCA on behalf of Greater Manchesterâ€™s accommodation delivery partners in the second round of funding between April 2022 and March 2025. The service will support to the residents of 60 homes upon completion and letting for a period of three years. The support will be at a ratio of 1:10 per keyworker. The contract may work with more than 60 individuals over the contract period dependent on the turnover of the properties.
