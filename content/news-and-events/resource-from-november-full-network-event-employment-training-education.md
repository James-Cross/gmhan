    Thanks again to everyone who attended the GMHAN & GMCA full Network Event:
    How do we improve Employment, Training & Education support for people who
    have experienced Homelessness? It was great to see so many of you there


    The day started with presentations on The Cost of Living Crisis- The Impact on Employment, Training & Education from GMPA and Employment, Training & Education as Homelessness Preventionfrom GMCA. You can check out the slides from all presentations [here](https://www.gmhan.net/assets/uploads/ete-event-slides.pdf)


    We asked attendees to share knowledge around what Employment, Training and Education provisions are available and what gaps there are in services across Greater Manchester- You told us [What you thought was available](https://www.gmhan.net/assets/uploads/what-support-is-available.docx) and [What you thought was missing](https://www.gmhan.net/assets/uploads/what-support-is-missing.pdf)


    N﻿ext we had an amazing poetry break from Invisible Manchester, the poem was part of the [Refuge from the Ravens](https://wordsworth.org.uk/refuge-from-the-ravens/) project which will be coming to Bury Art Gallery in February, and you can buy the Ravens book [here](https://www.oystercatcherpress.com/product/refuge-from-the-ravens/). Invisible Manchester have also shared a collection of poems in their [Writing on the Wall](https://wotwonline.co.uk/back-issues/) publications, which you can support on their [Go Fund Me](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-writing-on-the-wall-in-manchester?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_campaign=p_cf+share-flow-1) page if you are interested.


     We rounded up the day with four workshops, each focused on a different element of employment, training or education, and the barriers that are faced by people who have experienced homelessness
