    This year the COVID-19 outbreak has presented significant and fast-evolving challenges for the homelessness sector. Frontline services have been significantly impacted by staff capacity as people go into isolation and work from home, and that there has been severe consequences for the services provided on the frontline.\

    \

    This survey offers a unique opportunity for you, as a frontline worker to say what is and isn’t working when supporting people experiencing homelessness.\

    \

    It is a vital resource for decision-makers nationwide when developing strategies to reduce homelessness, so please complete and share with other frontline workers so your voice and the experience of our area can be heard.
