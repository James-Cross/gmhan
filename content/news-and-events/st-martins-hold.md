    The GM Homeless Action Network is exploring a potential partnership to
    develop our network and local activity with national charity St Martins In
    The Fields Frontline Network.


    We'll be looking for input and feedback from members on this proposal, as soon as a proposed outline for the partnership has been agreed by both groups.
