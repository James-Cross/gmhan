  heading: Proposal to become a St Martin's Local Network Partner
  body: >-
    The GMHAN is exploring a potential partnership with national charity [St
    Martin's in the Fields Frontline
    Network](https://www.frontlinenetwork.org.uk/), and seeking network member
    feedback. 


    Under the proposal, which you can download here, the GMHAN would join 7 existing Network Partners seeking to support frontline workers and influence decision making of responses to homelessness across the UK. Partnership would include funding to recruit a co-ordinator to support development of Network activities for three years. This post would be held by one of the GMHAN's local network members.


    Feedback on the partnership proposal will be considered by the GMHAN 'Strategy & Support Group' and Advisory Board's over October and November. You can leave your comments on the partnership proposal by:
