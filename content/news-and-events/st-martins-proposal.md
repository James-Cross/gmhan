  heading: Proposal for the GMHAN to become a St Martin's Local Network Partner
  body: >-
    The GMHAN is exploring a potential partnership with national charity [St
    Martin's in the Fields Frontline
    Network](https://www.frontlinenetwork.org.uk/), and seeking network member
    feedback. So far an initial Expression of Interest has been agreed, of which
    you can read a summary [here](link). 


    Discussions about the partnership are still very early and subject to both the HAN and St Martin's concluding it is right for both sides.  If would potentially see the GMHAN joining 7 existing Network Partners across the UK working to support frontline workers and influence decision making of responses to homelessness. A partnership would include funding to support a set of activities which are outlined in the current proposal. It is suggest any post would be held by one of the GMHAN's local network members.


    Feedback on the partnership proposal will be considered by the GMHAN 'Strategy & Support Group' and Advisory Board's over the autumn and winter, alongside further discussions and exploration with St Martin's. You can leave your comments on the partnership proposal by:
