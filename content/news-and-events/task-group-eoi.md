  heading: Do you want be part of ending and preventing homelessness in Greater
    Manchester? ining one of our new 'Task Groups'!
  body: >-
    The Greater Manchester Homelessness Action Network (GMHAN) is a
    collaboration of everyone working to end and prevent homelessness in Greater
    Manchester. It brings together all the different sectors, specialisms and
    experiences which are involved in achieving this mission, recognising that
    we can achieve more through collaboration and partnership


    Earlier this year the Network set up three Task Groups around the core purposes which will help us to reduce homelessness: Learn, Lobby and Deliver.


    The three task groups are beginning to establish their focus, but there is **still an opportunity to get involved**. 


    The task groups will focus on:


    **Learning:** understand what is working effectively to address homelessness, through insight from people who have experienced it, good practice happening on the ground or research from around the UK and beyond.


    **Lobbying**: take this learning to decision makers to make the case for necessary changes and hold those involved to account.


    **Delivering**: implementing these changes by designing solutions, creating the partnerships for them to work, and supporting those on the ground who are doing them.


    Participation expenses of Â£20/hour are available for anyone joining a Task Group who is unwaged, and the time commitment is between 3 and 5 hours per month.
