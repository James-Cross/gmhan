    We are hosting two online calls Today to discuss and agree an approach to 2
    key areas where the VCSE sector will respond. We highly value the different
    knowledge, ideas and perspectives that you can bring, and know the solution
    will be more effective if we can collaborate, so if it is possible please
    aim for one person from your organisation to attend.\

    \

    **10.30-11.30am: What might non face to face support look like?****\

    12-1pm: How might we provide food to people in single occupancy
    accommodation?**\

    \

    Both calls will be hosted on Zoom*:

    NB: For those in the Manchester area, there is also a conference call hosted
    by MCC at 2pm - insight from this call will feed into that as a basis for
    covering broader issues around Outreach and a partnership response.
