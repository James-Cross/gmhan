    This event is being run jointly by [Agenda](https://weareagenda.org/), AVA and the [Greater Manchester Homelessness Action Network](https://www.gmhan.net/) and forms part of the wider GMCA activities for pulling together knowledge and awareness and recommendations for the new GM homelessness prevention strategy. It will be attended by the GMCA Strategic Lead for rough sleeping and homelessness who is leading on strategy. 


    The webinar aims to gather evidence to and develop concrete recommendations aimed at Greater Manchester decision makers so they can ensure women’s experiences of homelessness are embedded across the new prevention strategy.


    ### **Who is this for:**


    This webinar is aimed at commissioners and strategic leads as well as frontline services and women with lived experience who are based in Greater Manchester and would like to have a say in the strategy. 


    **Please note this event is only for organisations and individuals that live and work in Greater Manchester: Bolton, Bury, Oldham, Rochdale, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford, Wigan and the cities of Manchester and Salford.**


    ### **Structure of event:**


    This workshop style event will offer an opportunity to hear from women with experience of homelessness, get an update on work happening across GMCA and understand the plan for the new homelessness prevention strategy. 


    A core part of the event will be a series of short workshops to discuss key themes relating to women’s homelessness including: 


    1. Mental health and women’s homelessness

    2. Gender-based violence and women’s homelessness

    3. No Recourse to public funds and migrant women’s experiences 

    4. LBT women’s experiences 

    5. Women’s Rough sleeping å

    6. Homeless families and women with children, including those who have faced the loss of child removal.


    We aim to take an intersectional approach that understands women’s experiences will be impacted by broader intersecting oppressions including but not limited to gender, race, sexuality and disability. 


    We will also test key recommendations around women’s homelessness.
