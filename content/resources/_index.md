    The more knowledge we all have about what is going on to end homelessness,
    the stronger we will be as a Network in identifying what is missing and
    holding each other to account when results aren't being delivered. 


    To help this, all publications, resources or papers relevant to ending homelessness in Greater Manchester will be published here. If you think anything is missing, contact us at [info@gmhan.net](mailto:info@gmhan.net).

    **A Bed Every Night – Reflection by Matthew Kidd from Creative Inclusion**


    In March 2021, the Homelessness Action Network held a learning event to reflect on people’s experiences of ABEN provision in Greater Manchester. Creative Inclusion was commissioned to write a [report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eCiw_Q5Lk98ybbOM2xIoRglh6rqsModm/view) which brings together different perspectives on how Greater Manchester can respond as a whole system to improve the experiences of people accessing ABEN. [Matthew Kid](https://twitter.com/mattyk14?mc_cid=053bfa4dcb&mc_eid=e35df83018) offers his reflections.


    You can [read here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jOp1dBF53-PNz_8uPuZ6z6jTmMXbBIBu/view) the independent evaluation that evaluates the effectiveness of ABEN by Dr Beth Watts and Lynne McCordie with Melissa Espinoza, Dora Welker, and Prof. Sarah Johnsen (The Institute for Social Policy, Housing, Equalities Research (I-SPHERE). In addition, we’d warmly invite you to contribute to the GM Homelessness Prevention Strategy to help develop an integrated rough sleeping response where no one is left behind.
