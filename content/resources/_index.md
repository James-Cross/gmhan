    The more knowledge we all have about what is going on to end homelessness,
    the stronger we will be as a Network in identifying what is missing and
    holding each other to account when results aren't being delivered. 


    To help this, all publications, resources or papers relevant to ending homelessness in Greater Manchester will be published here. If you think anything is missing, contact us at [info@gmhan.net](mailto:info@gmhan.net).

    outlines what the Network wants to see happen as we build back after COVID,
    based on multiple discussions in late-May 2020. Please comment on the link
