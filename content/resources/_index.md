    The more knowledge we all have about what is going on to food poverty, the
    stronger we will be as a Network in identifying what is missing and holding
    each other to account when results arenâ€™t being delivered.


    To help this, all publications, resources or papers relevant to ending food poverty in Greater Manchester will be published here. If you think anything is missing, contact us at info@gmfsan.net
